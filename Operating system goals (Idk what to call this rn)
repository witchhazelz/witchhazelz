Im making this OS because I finished DOOM nightmare level a while ago. (OS dev wiki reference)
I also feel like I want a more unique frame of customizability, where its more interactive and intuitive rather than just programming it all out (yes, I know, it sounds stupid but I like stupid challenges). 
While windows has a good range of GUI and such,it isn't as customizable as I want it to be. Linux is great, but I feel like a lot of the stuff is too "epic-gamery, 2018 style", and I dont like that..
So thats where I come in, I make a cute lil OS for a fun summer project! Basically, I just want an os that looks unique, aesthetically pleasing...
but also a powerhouse. Once I get the bare-bones, i'll turn it into something that can run some pretty high-tech programs and whatnot (my laptop will probably be fried but thats ok)

SPECS: 
-Hardware-
MODEL: Galaxy Book ion (you could probab
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz
GPU: Intel(R) UHD Graphics
Motherboard: SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD.  NP950XCJ-K01US  SGLA647A0D-C01-G004-S0001+10.0.19041

My operating system will start out as a x86 assembly very bare bones os but with a cool loading screen!!!, and we will go up from there!!
